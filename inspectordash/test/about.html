		<strong>What We Do</strong></span><span class="style2"><span class="style15"><br />
		Through the use of highly trained &#39;Teams&#39; consisting of a canine scent 
		detection dog and handler we identify the presence of bed bugs in homes, 
		apartments, planes, hotels, and anywhere else that they may have 
		&#39;hitchhiked&#39; to and nested. Services are available to homeowners, 
		property managers, pest control companies, real estate brokers, and 
		anyone that may need to successfully identify the presence of bed bugs. 
		Whether inspection is needed for one time service, follow up services, 
		or routine inspections, Discovery Dogs will tailor a plan that works for 
		you. <br />
		<br />
		</span></span><span class="style11"><strong>How We Started Doing 
		Inspections</strong></span><span class="style2"><span class="style15"><br />
		Our company was founded as a result of being owners/operators of 
		hospitality properties that faced the specter of bed bugs and the 
		uncertainty of how to deal with them on a daily basis. The fear of being 
		sued over something that was hard to understand led to a quest for 
		education on the best way to identify the problem early and to document 
		a history of being a responsible operator in the event that our systems 
		and procedures ever came into question. Furthermore, the engagement of 
		pest control operators that had a motivating interest in finding bed 
		bugs at our properties led to a level of suspicion of their motivation. 
		The goal is to empower homeowners or property managers with the the 
		knowledge about the presence of bed bugs quickly and quietly so that if 
		a plan needs to be implemented for extermination it can be done so as 
		early as possible.<br />
		<br />
		<span class="style11"><strong>Scent Detection Canines</strong></span><span class="style14"><br />
		The training of our dogs is identical to the training employed for the 
		detection of bombs and drugs and we take the outcome of our inspections 
		and follow up just as seriously. Although the accuracy rate of canine 
		detection exceeds 95%, it is only as good as the handlers ability to 
		communicate with clients and visually identify clues and patterns 
		consistent with the presence of a bed bug infestation. Our dog and 
		handler &#39;Team&#39; becomes the most effective weapon in the detection of 
		these elusive pests and having us on your team makes sure that if 
		extermination is required that it is done effectively and appropriately. 
		We are in the business of <span class="style16">inspections</span>,
		<span class="style16">not extermination</span>, and have no financial 
		motivation to find infestations which would then provide opportunity for 
		more revenue. Our favorite inspections are the ones where we provide 
		nothing but relief! </span><br />
		<br />
		</span></span></span><span class="style12"><strong>Discretion</strong></span><span class="style2"><span class="style13"><span class="style15"><br />
		The presence of bed bugs, even the suspicion that there may be bed bugs, 
		can be a very sensitive issue. Guest, staff, or neighbor perception is 
		often critical to our clients. With this in mind Discovery Dogs is very 
		discreet in what we do. No pest control trucks, no uniforms, and well 
		thought out replies to questions placed by the people we work around. 
		The dogs are small and well behaved and our handlers are held to a 
		standard of conduct that contemplates the interest and sensitivity of 
		the process and how it can be perceived by everyone involved.<br />
		<br />
		</span></span></span><span class="style13"><span class="style11">
		<strong>How Do We Get Started</strong></span><span class="style2"><span class="style15"><br />
		Just call or use the contact form for any questions, price inquiries, 
		concerns and anything else that comes to mind. We will be more then 
		happy to respond, and yes, even if you just need information.<br />
		<br />
		Thank you for your interest and we will be looking forward to working 
		with you.</span></span><span class="style14"><br />
