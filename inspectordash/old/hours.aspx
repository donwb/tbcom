    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
    Through the use of highly trained 'Teams' consisting of a canine scent detection dog and handler we
     identify the presence of bed bugs in homes, apartments, planes, hotels, and anywhere else that they may have 'hitchhiked' to and nested.  
     Services are available to homeowners, property managers, pest control companies, real estate brokers, and anyone that may need to successfully i
     dentify the presence of bed bugs.  Whether inspection is needed for one time service, follow up services, or routine inspections, Discovery Dogs 
     will tailor a plan that works for you. 
     </p>

    <h2>How We Started Doing Inspections</h2>
    <p>
    Discovery Dogs was founded as a result of being owners/ operators of hospitality properties that faced the specter of bed bugs and the uncertainty of 
    how to deal with them on a daily basis. The fear of being sued over something that was hard to understand led to a quest for education on the best way 
    to identify the problem early and to document a history of being a responsible operator in the event that our systems and procedures ever came into question. 
     Furthermore, the engagement of pest control operators that had a motivating interest in finding bed bugs at our properties led to a level of suspicion of their motivation.  
     At Discovery Dogs the goal is to empower homeowners or property managers with the the knowledge about the presence of bed bugs quickly and quietly so that if a 
     plan needs to be implemented for extermination it can be done so as early as possible.
     </p>

    <h2>Discretion</h2>
    <p>
    The presence of bed bugs, even the suspicion  that there may be bed bugs, can be a very sensitive issue.  Guest, staff, or neighbor perception is often critical 
    to our clients.  With this in mind Discovery Dogs is very discreet in what we do.  No pest control trucks, no uniforms, and well thought out replies to questions
     placed by the people we work around.  The dogs are small and well behaved and our handlers are held to a standard of conduct that contemplates the interest and 
     sensitivity of the process and how it can be perceived by everyone involved.
