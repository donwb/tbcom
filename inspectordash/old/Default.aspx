            <h2> The Bed Bug Problem</h2>

            <p>
            The inability to easily exterminate bed bugs with modern pesticides has led to a resurgence in recent years.  Furthermore, the hysteria created by news reports, blogs, and third party experiences about bed bug infestations and how to deal with them has taken a problem that can be easily managed in many cases, and turned it into chaos.  Perfectly good furniture being thrown out, living out of plastic bags, moving out of homes in some cases.  Normally these things can be avoided by simply identifying if the problem really exists and then planning accordingly.  Identification is the key to implementing that successful plan and that is what Discovery Dogs do, identify the presence of bed bugs quickly, quietly, and effectively.

            <h2>The Discovery Dog Approach</h2>

            <p>
            By using highly trained scent detection canines, coupled with diligent visual searching, we are able to identify the presence of bed bugs in homes, hotels, 
            apartments, planes, schools, ships, etc.  There are other companies providing this service, many of which will be in and out of your facility quicker, 
            but none that will match the level of professionalism, diligence, and compassion that we provide Enough emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of a 
            diligent handler and well trained canine making an effective team. Please feel free to call and discuss our methodology, training, and approach before making a decision.
            The training of our dogs is identical to the training employed for the detection of bombs and drugs . and we take the outcome of our inspections and follow up 
            just as seriously. Although the accuracy rate of canine detection exceeds 95%, it is only as good as the handlers ability to communicate with clients and visually 
            identify clues and patterns consistent with the presence of a bed bug infestation. Our dog and handler 'Team' becomes the most effective weapon in the detection of 
            these elusive pests and having us on your team makes sure that if extermination is required that it is done effectively and appropriately. 
            We are in the business of inspections, not extermination, and have no financial motivation to find infestations which would then provide opportunity 
            for more revenue. Our favorite inspections are the ones where we provide nothing but relief!

            <p>
            Please do not hesitate to simply call and talk about what you have seen, heard, worry about, etc.  
            Sometimes just having someone to discuss bed bug questions with is all that our clients want and need, 
            and we are happy to be here for you. Good business starts with public advocacy and a sincere desire to help, 
            the rest works itself out!
