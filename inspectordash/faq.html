   <td class="style9"><strong><span class="style11">1. How accurate is a bed bug 
	dog at detecting bed bugs, if I have an inspection will I know for certain 
	that I have them or not?</span></strong><span class="style11"><br>
	</span><span class="style10"><span class="style11">Bed bugs dogs rate in a 
	very high accuracy range, from 96%-98%. There is no system that can be 100% 
	accurate in detecting bed bugs and to attempt to state so would be 
	misleading.<br>
	<br>
	</span></span><strong><span class="style11">2. I have a pet, will this be a 
	problem if I want my home inspected by Dash?</span></strong><span class="style10"><span class="style11"><br>
	We request that pets be removed from the inspection location if possible, if 
	it is not possible to take a pet offsite, putting them into a bathroom for a 
	short while is the next best thing. Remember a scent detection dog is still 
	a dog. All animals in general are subject to detecting the presence of other 
	animals.<br>
	<br>
	</span></span><strong><span class="style11">3. If Dash alerts to bed bugs in 
	my home, how will you eliminate them?</span></strong><span class="style11"><span class="style10"><br>
	We are not exterminators. We detect the presence of bed bugs and report to 
	you our findings, however an exterminator&#39;s service will be necessary if bed 
	bugs are found.<br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>4. I have a large office space that I need inspected. It has 
	multiple cubicles and offices and takes up two floors in the building our 
	company is located in. Can Dash inspect a space this size and how long will 
	it take?</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	In the interest of maximizing Dash&#39;s effectiveness and alertness, we utilize 
	a specific working formula to not exhaust a dog. Dash will work in intervals 
	of approximately one hour scan time, a ten to fifteen minute break time and 
	then return to scanning. This gives Dash an opportunity to rest, have a walk 
	or tend to any other need. By working in this interval Dash can continue for 
	between four and six hours of steady work. How long it takes to scan 
	commercial space will be governed by many factors inclusive of access to 
	offices, layout of the floor itself, amount of cubicles vs. offices etc. <br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>5. Does your dog bark when he is alerting to bed bugs? I am 
	concerned that if I have an alert the dog will make a lot of noise.</strong><br>
	</span><span class="style12">Dash is trained to alert by sitting and 
	additional body language that a handler will be attentive to. He does not 
	bark.<br>
	<br>
	</span><span class="style11"><strong>6. Can Dash detect if my neighbor has 
	bed bugs through my walls?</strong></span><span class="style12"><br>
	Bed bugs will very often travel through electrical sockets and along wiring 
	conduits, as well they can infest openings in baseboard molding and move 
	under certain types of walls. Depending on the how air tight an area is that 
	is being inspected by Dash, he may or may not be able to detect a problem on 
	the other side of certain types of walls. If you are inspecting your 
	apartment because you want to determine if your neighbor has bed bugs, it 
	would not be advisable to rely on this approach to determine a problem in an 
	apartment adjacent to your own.<br>
	<br>
	</span><span class="style11"><strong>7. How do I know that Dash does not 
	have bed bugs and is not carrying them into my home?<br>
	</strong><span class="style10">Often times people think of bed bugs in the 
	same fashion they think of fleas. Bed bugs do not prefer to feed off of 
	animals because of the lack of exposure to their skin. Bed bugs would be 
	easily visible on an animal had they hitched a ride. Whereas humans can 
	carry a hitch hiking bed bug on their clothing, work gear, travel bags, 
	laptop cases and any other place a bug can crawl into, dogs are not wearing 
	clothes and nor carrying bags. <br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>8. I am about to move into an apartment, can I have it 
	checked for bed bugs before I move?</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	Absolutely. In addition you should question the management company or real 
	estate agent involved in your move about previous problems, if any, in the 
	apartment or building.<br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>9. Are you exterminators? I have read articles about 
	exterminators who have bed bug dogs where there were alleged alerts to bed 
	bugs followed by the exterminator obtaining a treatment job.</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	No we are not exterminators, we are independent and have no vested interest 
	in finding bed bugs in your home or office.<br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>10. Can Dash search my boat?<br>
	</strong><span class="style10">Yes. Dash can work in almost all environments 
	that have human use. Boats, hotels, offices, apartments, houses as well as 
	other living and use spaces.<br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>11. How does the handler know if Dash is tracking a bed bug 
	scent or my cat, or even the food crumbs I dropped from my toast?</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	Dash is observed for his body language and alerts. He will not alert to 
	other animals or food on the floor. <br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>12. How do you know Dash&#39;s abilities to find bed bugs are &#39;up 
	to speed&#39;?</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	Dash does continual training several times a week to keep his nose and 
	skills sharp.<br>
	<br>
	</span><strong>13. I am an animal lover and although I know that dogs have a 
	remarkable sense of smell I am concerned with how much a work dog works. I 
	have heard that some canine search dogs live in cages and are only taken out 
	to perform their duties. How do I feel good in clear conscious about a dog 
	being used to do this kind of job?</strong><span class="style10"><br>
	Dogs are natural hunters. When Dash is searching for bed bugs he is doing 
	something he enjoys to do, hunting. Dash also lives at home with his handler 
	when not working and is absolutely one of man&#39;s best friends. When Dash is 
	working extensive square footage sites, he is rested once an hour and even 
	may have some play time to liven up his work experience. </span></span></td>
