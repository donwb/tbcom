This is done to protect them from being copied or reused in an unauthorized manner.

The photographs you purchase consist of all archival materials including paper, ink, 8-ply mat board, and backing.  Frames are 1" black wood using non-reflective UV filtered glass.

It is not recommended to hang your photograph in a place that receives direct sunlight.  
If you purchased an unframed photo and plan to frame it yourself, it is highly recommended to use UV filtered glass for protection.
